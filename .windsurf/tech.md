You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, next-intl, and Zod, axios.

Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., features/auth, components/common).
- Favor named exports for components and utilities.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

Project Architecture

- Follow feature-based architecture: `src/features/[feature-name]/`
- Each feature contains: components/, hooks/, services/, store/, types/, constants/, utils/
- Shared components go in `src/shared/components/`
- Global state management with Zustand stores
- Internationalization with next-intl (no URL routing, cookie-based)
- Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix for src/ directory

JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use const objects or maps.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).
- Export types and interfaces from feature-specific types/index.ts files.

State Management & Data Flow

- Use Zustand for client state management with devtools middleware.
- Create feature-specific stores (e.g., authStore, registrationStore).
- Use selectors for derived state and performance optimization.
- Implement store actions that handle both optimistic updates and error states.
- Use React Query/TanStack Query for server state (if implemented).
- Services layer should throw user-friendly errors for consistent error handling.

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:

  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
- Use Zod schemas for all form validation and API data validation.
- Create reusable validation schemas in constants/ directories.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

React/Next.js

- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX with proper accessibility attributes.
- Use function keyword for components, not const.
- Use Shadcn UI and Radix components for consistent UI.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS using mobile-first approach.
- Place static content and interfaces at file end.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Minimize 'use client' directive. Prefer RSC when possible.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with meaningful fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, proper sizing, lazy loading.

Tailwind CSS 4+ Styling Rules

- Use predefined design tokens for consistent spacing, colors, and typography.
- Create custom utility classes in `globals.css` for frequently used patterns and component variants.
- Define reusable classes like `.btn-primary`, `.card-elevated`, `.text-gradient` in global CSS.
- Spacing: Prefer `gap-4`, `p-4`, `m-4` over arbitrary values like `gap-[16px]`.
- Colors: Use semantic color classes `text-primary`, `bg-background`, `border-border`.
- Typography: Use `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg` instead of arbitrary font sizes.
- Breakpoints: Use standard responsive prefixes `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`.
- Layout: Use `flex`, `grid`, `space-y-4`, `space-x-4` for consistent layouts.
- Shadows: Prefer `shadow-sm`, `shadow`, `shadow-lg` over custom shadow values.
- Borders: Use `rounded-md`, `rounded-lg`, `border` instead of arbitrary border values.
- Transitions: Use `transition-colors`, `transition-transform` for smooth interactions.
- Hover states: Apply consistent hover effects with `hover:bg-accent`, `hover:text-accent-foreground`.
- Focus states: Always include `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring` for accessibility.
- Dark mode: Use `dark:` prefix with semantic colors for theme consistency.
- Combine multiple utility classes into single custom classes in globals.css for complex repeated patterns.

Internationalization (i18n)

- Use next-intl for translations without URL routing.
- Access translations with `useTranslations()` hook.
- Use namespaced translations (e.g., `useTranslations('auth')`).
- Support RTL languages (Arabic) with proper dir attributes.
- Store locale preference in NEXT_LOCALE cookie.
- Use descriptive translation keys with dot notation.

Forms and User Input

- Use react-hook-form with Zod resolver for form validation.
- Use Shadcn Form components for consistent form styling.
- Implement proper form error handling and user feedback.
- Use controlled components for complex form interactions.
- Handle loading states during form submission.
- Validate phone numbers with react-phone-number-input.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

1. Use Next.js 15 App Router for routing and navigation.
2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) and performance.
3. Minimize 'use client' usage:
   - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features.
   - Use 'use client' only for interactivity, forms, and browser APIs.
   - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching when possible.
4. Follow consistent file naming and organization.
5. Use TypeScript strict mode and proper type definitions.
6. Implement proper loading states and error boundaries.
7. Support both English and Arabic with RTL layout.
8. Use semantic HTML and proper accessibility attributes.
